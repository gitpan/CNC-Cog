Cog version 0.061
=================

Changes to packaging so that installation works correctly 
under Linux. No functional changes here. 

cog version 0.06
================

cog.pm, a module for cutting cogwheels from sheet metal. 

At the moment we do horological cogs only using equations
tightly based on British Standard for this type of wheel. 

There are also some functions for cutting a Graham type 
escapement (wheel and yoke). 

This software is in a very early stage of development. 

See the file cogtest.pl for example usage.

This code has been developed under Windows 98SE. I have 
not tested it under any other operating system, but 
do not expect operating system dependencies. 


EXAMPLES

artifacts produced and the output from the cog.pm module

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  GD - If and only if you intend to view graphical output. 

OPERATING SYSTEM

This module has been developed under Windows 98 and  Perl 5.8
I thought it would work under Linux, but when I tried it under Suse 10
I found it doesnt. Its all to do with the packaging: line feed format, 
lack of execute permissions on directories, and even wrong capitalisation
on file names. I've sadly given up on this for the moment. I'll
restate my original point: if you are able to get it installed under Linux, 
you probably find it works.
